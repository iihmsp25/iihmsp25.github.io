        The submitted works should not have been published before and should not be under consideration for publication anywhere else. 
        The submission of the work should have been approved by all co-authors, if any. 
        The submitted works must represent the authors’ contributions and must not be copied or plagiarized in whole or in part from other works. 
        If the authors have used the work and/or words of others, this has to be appropriately cited or quoted. 
        The authors must disclose all and any actual or potential conflicts of interest with their work or partial benefits associated with it.

        To make sure the academic ethics of papers in iCAST 2017, we use the Turnitin system to check the similarity score of each submission. 
        When the similarity score of the submitted paper is higher than 30% (total), we remember the author to revise his/her paper and remind that the paper may not be included in the IEEE Xplore digital library and other indexes (EI/Scopus). If the similarity score of the final paper is higher than 30% (total), it will not be submitted to any publication.

        <label style="font-weight:bolder; color:blue">◆ Date Exposed:</label> March 18, 2018<br />
        <label style="font-weight:bolder; color:blue">◆ Related Paper:</label> Using Conceptual Framework for Target Tracking Based on Wireless Sensor Networks, included in iCAST 2017 proceedings, pp. 23-26<br />
        <label style="font-weight:bolder; color:blue">◆ Final Disposal:</label> On March 19, 2018, a meeting hosted by General Chair, Prof. Li-Hua Li, was conducted to investigate the case mentioned above. The case is confirmed as a plagiarism issue. The meeting reaches the following final disposals:<br />
        <label style="margin-left:1em">(a) Inform the authors the final disposals made for the case.</label><br />
        <label style="margin-left:1em">(b) Announce this misconduct on the iCAST 2017 website.</label><br />
        <label style="margin-left:1em">(c) iCAST conference will put misconduct authors into black list.</label><br />
        <label style="margin-left:1em">(d) Suggest the IEEE to withdraw the paper from IEEE Xplore Digital Library as soon as possible.</label><br />
        <label style="font-weight:bolder; color:blue">◆ Explanation:</label> The initial submission had been checked by Turnitin system with acceptable similarity on August 1, 2017. It was passed our similarity verification by using Turnitin system. However, the final submission has very high degree of similarity to the paper ‘A Conceptual Framework for Implementing a WSN Based Cattle Recovery System in Case of Cattle Rustling in Kenya’ which was published on August 31, 2017 (https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7080/5/3/54). Due to the final submission was not gone through Turnitin system again, it was accepted and included in the proceedings of iCAST 2017. Thus this misconduct happened. In addition, we have checked every final paper of iCAST 2017 in IEEE again, and there exists no any plagiarism problem.<br />
        <label style="font-weight:bolder; color:blue">◆ Introspection:</label> We sincerely apologize for this misconduct happened in iCAST 2017. In the future, iCAST will conduct more rigorous checking processes, and will carefully verify the papers before publication to avoid plagiarism.
